Real-Time Object Detection from Video Streams
This repository contains a Python-based real-time object detection application designed to identify and localize objects within video streams using the powerful YOLOv5 model. This project demonstrates a practical application of deep learning and computer vision for dynamic visual analysis.

üåü Overview
This application processes video footage frame by frame, leveraging a pre-trained YOLOv5 model to detect various objects. The detected objects are highlighted with bounding boxes and displayed in real-time, offering an intuitive and dynamic visualization of object presence and location. The project emphasizes efficiency and ease of use, making it suitable for quick deployment and experimentation.

‚ú® Features
Instantaneous Object Detection: Achieves near real-time performance in identifying and localizing multiple objects in video streams.

High-Performance Model Integration: Utilizes the highly optimized YOLOv5s model from Ultralytics, known for its excellent balance of speed and accuracy.

Versatile Video Input: Supports processing of pre-recorded video files and can be easily adapted for live camera feeds (e.g., webcam, CCTV streams).

Clear Visual Output: Renders bounding boxes and detection results directly onto the video frames using OpenCV, providing immediate and intuitive visual feedback.

Pythonic & Modular Design: Built with clear, well-structured Python code, ensuring maintainability, readability, and extensibility.

üöÄ How It Works
The core of this real-time object detection system operates through a streamlined pipeline:

Model Loading: A pre-trained yolov5s model is loaded directly from PyTorch Hub using torch.hub.load. This provides robust object recognition capabilities without requiring local model weights.

Video Stream Capture: The cv2.VideoCapture function from OpenCV is used to open and capture video frames sequentially from the specified video file.

Real-Time Inference: Each captured frame is passed as input to the loaded YOLOv5 model. The model then performs rapid inference to detect objects within that frame.

Result Rendering: The detection results (which include bounding box coordinates, class labels, and confidence scores) are processed. OpenCV's drawing functionalities are then used to overlay these bounding boxes and labels directly onto the original video frame.

Live Visualization: The annotated frames are displayed in a dedicated window using cv2.imshow, providing a continuous, real-time visual feed of detected objects. The process continues in a loop until the user explicitly quits.

üõ†Ô∏è Setup and Installation
To get this project up and running on your local machine, follow these steps:

Prerequisites
Python 3.7+ installed.

git installed and configured on your system.

Steps
Clone the YOLOv5 Repository:
First, clone the official Ultralytics YOLOv5 repository, as this project relies on its structure and dependencies.

git clone https://github.com/ultralytics/yolov5
cd yolov5

Install Dependencies:
Navigate into the yolov5 directory and install all required Python packages listed in requirements.txt. This includes torch, opencv-python, matplotlib, numpy, and others.

pip install -r requirements.txt

(Note: This step might take some time as it downloads PyTorch and other large libraries. A stable internet connection is recommended.)

Place Your Video File:
Place the video file you wish to analyze (e.g., Motorway CCTV - 4 Split - 10mins - 1280 x 720.mp4) in a location accessible by your Python script. You will need to update the video variable in your script (your_script_name.py) with the correct, full path to your video file.

üèÉ Usage
Once the setup is complete, you can run the real-time object detection application:

Navigate to your script's directory:
Open your terminal or command prompt and change your current directory to where your Python script (your_script_name.py) is saved.

cd path/to/your/script

Execute the Script:
Run the Python script using the Python interpreter.

python your_script_name.py

(Replace your_script_name.py with the actual name of your Python file.)

View Detections:
A new window will appear, displaying the video stream with bounding boxes drawn around detected objects in real-time.

Exit the Application:
To close the detection window and stop the script, simply press the 'q' key on your keyboard.

‚öôÔ∏è Customization Options
This project is designed to be easily customizable:

Video Source:
Modify the video variable in the script to change the input source. You can use:

A different video file path: video = "path/to/your/new_video.mp4"

A live webcam feed: cap = cv2.VideoCapture(0) (for the default webcam).

YOLOv5 Model Size:
Experiment with different YOLOv5 model sizes (e.g., 'yolov5n', 'yolov5m', 'yolov5l', 'yolov5x') by changing the argument in model = torch.hub.load('ultralytics/yolov5', 'yolov5s'). Larger models offer higher accuracy but require more computational resources.

Confidence Thresholds:
(Requires minor code modification) You can add a confidence threshold to filter out less certain detections. This involves accessing the results.pandas().xyxy[0] dataframe and filtering rows based on the 'conf' column before rendering.
